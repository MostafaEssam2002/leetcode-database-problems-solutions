## ðŸ§¾ Table: `borrowing_records`

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| record_id     | int     |
| book_id       | int     |
| borrower_name | varchar |

## ðŸ§  Problem

Write a solution to find all books that are **currently borrowed** (i.e., `return_date IS NULL`) and have **zero available copies** in the library.

Return the result table ordered by:
1. `current_borrowers` in **descending order**
2. `title` in **ascending order**

| book_id | title            | author        | genre     | publication_year | current_borrowers |
|---------|------------------|---------------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1       | The Great Gatsby | F. Scott      | Fiction   | 1925             | 3                 |

## âœ… Explanation:

- **The Great Gatsby**  
  Borrowed by 3 people, total copies = 3 â†’ available = 0

- **1984**  
  Borrowed by 1 person, total copies = 1 â†’ available = 0

Books like _To Kill a Mockingbird_, _Pride and Prejudice_, etc., have some available copies, so they are not included.

```sql
SELECT 
  library_books.book_id,
  title,
  author,
  genre,
  publication_year,
  COUNT(library_books.book_id) AS current_borrowers
FROM

  AND borrowing_records.return_date IS NULL
GROUP BY 
  library_books.book_id, title, author, genre, publication_year, total_copies
HAVING 
  library_books.total_copies - COUNT(library_books.book_id) = 0
